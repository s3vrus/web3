My first take on making a web 3.0 site. The purpose is to have a way to check on how all of the different collections you own are doing so you dont have to go click on all of them individually on OpenSea. If you look at the code you'll notice a lot of extra things or stuff I commented out. I origianlly had high ambitions for making a full on NFT all in one kind of site but I decided to tone it back for times sake. Might come back to it in the future and finish what I had started
